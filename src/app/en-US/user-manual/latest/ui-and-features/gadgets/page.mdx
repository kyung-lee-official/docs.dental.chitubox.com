## Slider

The slider is located on the right side of the main window and is used to preview the cross-sectional area of the model (pre-slice) and the layers of the model (post-slice). The slider component allows users to preview the individual parts and layers of a 3D model before it is sent to the printer, assess the quality of the model, and then make adjustments as needed.
