# Configure Support Parameters

Click <ChituboxSupport /> icon on the left side of the main window to open the support panel. We will go through the support parameters one by one.

CHITUBOX Provides 3 default support settings: Light, Medium, and Heavy. If these are not suitable for your model, you can click the <ChituboxProfileAddIcon />"Add configuration" button to add a new support configuration file and customize the support settings. You can also <ChituboxProfileRenameIcon />rename, <ChituboxProfileSettingsIcon />edit, and <ChituboxProfileDeleteIcon />delete support settings here.

## Add supports

### Automatically

Click the Auto Support button to automatically add supports to the selected model according to the specified support settings.

### Manually

Move the cursor to the desired location and click the left mouse button to add support.
