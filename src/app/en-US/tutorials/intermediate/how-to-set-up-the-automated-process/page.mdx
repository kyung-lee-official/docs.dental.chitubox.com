# How to Set Up the Automated Process?

Automatic process is one of the key features in CHITUBOX Dental that can help streamline the workflow and improve the efficiency for dental professionals, and there are some details that need to be paid attention to when using it.

In the current version V1.1.1, the automation process has five application scenarios, which are the orthodontic model, restorative model, surgical guide, splint, and temporary crown&bridge. This function built in multiple algorithms to apply for different applications, so the user must select the right application scenario for their models when using automatic process. If you want to prepare the surgical guide but choose the application scenario of the orthodontic model, the algorithm is applied wrong and the preparation effect may not be the best.

When using the software for the first time, you need to select the printer and application before importing the model. You can also change the steps of the automatic process and adjust the function parameters in "Settings". In addition, you can also modify the material parameters and printing parameters in "Advanced Settings" and enable the precision compensation functions such as Anti-aliasing and Scale Compensation, according to your own printing needs to adjust the screen transmittance and improve the accuracy of the model.

After completing the settings and entering the operation interface, you only need to import the model, and then click the "Automatically Process" button at the top of the interface to complete all model preparation steps with one click. Finally, you can start the printing process by clicking the "Slice" button to get the slice file.

If you want to modify the settings, he can click the arrow next to the project name in the lower left corner to enter the settings page from the "Settings" option. After completing the adjustment, click "Apply" and return to the preparation interface.

If you need to deal with different applications frequently, you can create different configurations in advance, and the configurations will be automatically saved in the software, and you can directly select the corresponding application scenario to process the model the next time you open the software. In order to facilitate the distinction, you can modify the configuration's name, so that it can be distinct quickly and applied to the automatic process of the corresponding scenario, which can greatly improve the work efficiency and convenience.
