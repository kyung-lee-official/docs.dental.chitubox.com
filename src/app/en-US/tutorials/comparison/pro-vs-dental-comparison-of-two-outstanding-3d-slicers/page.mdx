# Pro vs Dental: Comparison of Two Outstanding 3D Slicers

As additive manufacturing technology matures, 3D printing technology has gradually penetrated into various industries, and many outstanding new software and hardware products have emerged in an endless stream. With the popularization and deepening of 3D printing technology in dentistry, users' demand for related software has gradually increased. The CHITUBOX series of software not only provides a free version of CHITUBOX Basic slicer software for general printing needs, but also develops a Pro version of advanced slicer software for users who pursue higher precision. In July 2024, a professional slicer software for dental applications, CHITUBOX Dental, was launched. We have analyzed [the differences between the Basic version and the Dental version](https://dental.chitubox.com/en/article/dental/news/Education/vsbasic) before. So, what are the differences in positioning and functions between the Pro version and the Dental version? This article will tell you which software is more suitable for you.

## Product Positioning

The Pro version was designed to meet the needs of senior users for more printing accuracy and model preparation when it was first launched， which suitable to prepare the models of trendy figures. Due to the high complexity of the models, the requirements for software functions have also increased accordingly. Pro 2.0, which was launched in October 2024, is a significant improvement over the old version. In addition to a more modern interactive interface and more intelligent algorithms, a series of new features have been introduced to make the experience of senior 3D printing fans smoother and more efficient.

Unlike the rich functional sectors of CHITUBOX Pro, CHITUBOX Dental was designed with the uniqueness of the high customization of dentistry. Dental practitioners have always used the traditional manual production mode to produce dentures and related products. They may be unfamiliar with computer operations, and some production processes still need to be completed manually. 3D printing technology only replaces parts of the processes. Given that dental professionals may not have deep contact with 3D printing technology, CHITUBOX Dental focuses more on the practicality of functions and the simplicity of the interface, and therefore developed the powerful automatic process function that can complete model preparation with one click, aiming to bring a minimalist operation experience to dental practitioners and reduce the learning cost of them.
 
## UI interface

For the reason mentioned above, the interface of CHITUBOX Dental is very concise, with the functional modules concentrated on the left side of the operation area. Its functions and settings are streamlined and optimized based on industry customs, and the model files and printing-related parameters in the current project are directly displayed on the right side of the operation area. Users can intuitively see which case the model they are processing belongs to. In CHITUBOX Dental, users do not need to deeply understand and learn the operating logic and background knowledge behind each function, but only need to focus on what these functions could do.

The operation interface of CHITUBOX Pro has many subdivided functions, and the settings are complex. For the support function, which is the highlight of the software, the settings are also much richer than those of the Dental version. Professional users can set them up independently. For senior 3D printing users, it is a practical tool for achieving high-precision printing, but for freshmen, it is a software with a high learning cost.

## Function

### Software Configuration

The new version of CHITUBOX Pro 2.0 is linked to the Resin Profiles Library, allowing users to directly use the tested resin material parameters officially provided by the material manufacturer. This reduces the user's printing failure and operating costs. At present, CHITUBOX is also further strengthening its cooperation with resin manufacturers in order to provide users with richer resin parameter resources.

	}
	style={{ width: "360px" }}

Although the current version of CHITUBOX Dental hasn't been connected to the Resin Profiles Library, the software has built-in printing parameters for commonly used dental printers. Users do not need to do complex printing tests. They can start printing directly based on official material parameters. In addition, in order to produce processing effects that are more suitable for dental products, Dental software has added the steps of selecting dental applications in the printer configuration process, supporting more than a dozen commonly used dental applications including dental model, implant guide, temporary crown, etc. Each application is configured with a corresponding algorithm to process the model better. These configurations enable dental professionals to easily achieve ideal printing effects without spending a lot of time on fine-tuning.

### Model Preparation

** CHITUBOX Pro **

CHITUBOX Pro has built-in various powerful functions for model preparation to help users achieve different printing effects for various complex models.

The automatic layout allows users to set different model spacing and arrangement methods, which can be applied to all models or only the selected models. The copy function supports users to add models in batches. The added models will be neatly arranged in an array, and users do not need to layout them again.The hollowing function is compatible with the filling function which supports three different filling structures, and the hollowing accuracy and filling density can be customized. The punching function has detailed hole size settings. For the model itself, users can use the Boolean function to merge, cut, or only keep the intersection area of   models, or use the cutting function to split the model. The analysis and measurement module provides different tools to help users capture various precise distances and sizes during the model preparation stage, and complete the precise scaling and orientation of the model.

The new version, Pro 2.0, has made a breakthrough in functionality, adding two new functions — ChituAction and Magic Support.
ChituAction is the same as Dental's one-click process. Users can automate simple model preparation and adjust the steps of the automated process according to their needs. However, for complex models, it is necessary to fine-tune step by step according to user needs.

Magic Support can help users who need elaborate support to complete the support steps quickly. When users deal with complex models, they often need to combine several different support types. Magic Support allows it to automatically generate multiple support types with one click through customized settings. Users can also add support configuration and personalize the required support steps based on their experience, which can greatly reduce the time and energy users spend on support steps, improve efficiency and printing success rate, and minimize the impact of support on the model surface.

	}
	style={{ width: "360px" }}

This series of functions makes the Pro version very capable when facing highly complex models, but for dental practitioners, too many setting buttons will increase the difficulty of understanding and use, which is not conducive to rapid production.
 
** CHITUBOX Dental **

For CHITUBOX Dental, the biggest highlight is its "one-click processing" function. After completing the configuration of the machine and printing profile, users can directly use the automatic process above the interface to complete all pre-preparation steps. Unlike the ChituAction in the Pro version, the one-click processing function of the Dental version has adopted corresponding algorithms for different dental applications, and complete automatic orientation, layout, hollowing, drilling, and adding support according to the geometric features of the model to obtain slice files that better meet the needs of dental printing.

	}
	style={{ width: "360px" }}

Take dental models as an example.

The orientation function of CHITUBOX Dental automatically places the dental model bottom flattened on the built platform, ensuring a high printing success rate while avoiding the support affecting the teeth morphology of the dental model.

The hollowing function of CHITUBOX Dental uses a unique algorithm. The model will be hollowed out with a smooth inner wall according to its contour, minimizing the generation of overhanging points. By combining the hollowing function with the filling function, the user can complete the hollowing and filling in one step. The model will be automatically filled inside after hollowing out according to the selected filling type and parameters, saving dental professionals' operation time. There is a unique function in both the hollowing and filling settings — Fixed height filling, which only fills the bottom part of the model. This function can maximize the resin savings while ensuring the adhesion between the model and the platform.

The filling function of CHITUBOX Dental also has two unique designs — Through holes and Dome structures. The through holes could speed up the resin's flow back to the material vat and eliminate negative pressure during printing. The user can set parameters to adjust the size and spacing of the through holes. Due to the groove face of the posterior teeth, it is prone to generate many overhanging areas after hollowing out at these positions. The dome structure is designed to solve this problem. During the filling process of the posterior teeth, a dome structure will be automatically generated in the overhanging area, saving resin materials for internal support and improving the printing success rate.

	}
	style={{ width: "360px" }}

CHITUBOX Dental's drilling function not only supports batch drilling, but also generates half-circle holes at the bottom of the model close to the printing platform, so that the model printed without support can avoid the impact of negative pressure on the model accuracy.

The above dome structure and half-circle holes enable the model to be printed without support, saving resin materials and printing time. If the user wants to add support, CHITUBOX Dental also inherits the multi-type support function of the Pro version, allowing users to choose the required support size to assist printing.

Finally, the layout function of the Dental version can nest the dental model, maximizing the printing platform's space utilization and saving the user operating cost of large-volume printing.

All of the above functions are included in the automated process. Users can complete model preparation with one click by setting the relevant parameters in advance. When the user selects other dental applications, the software will call the corresponding algorithm and finally output the preparation results suitable for the application.

In addition, CHITUBOX Dental provides basic functions such as adding tags, bridge generators, and cutting. It helps users mark models, slow down model deformation or breakage, and obtain models of appropriate height.


## Conclusion

As two separate slicer software for light-curing printing, CHITUBOX Pro and CHITUBOX Dental have their own characteristics from interface design to functions for different user groups and needs.

Pro provides more modifiable parameters and options for senior printing users. These settings allow users to customize models to some extent and improve the printing effect of complex models.

Dental is suitable for dental professionals. The simple interface and practical functions save users' operation and learning costs to the greatest extent. By matching powerful algorithms for different dental applications, users can realize efficient and stable printing, allowing dental labs to speed up production progress and allowing dentists to devote more energy to treatment plans.
