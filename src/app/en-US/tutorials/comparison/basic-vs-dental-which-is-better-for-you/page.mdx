# Basic vs Dental: which is better for you?

With the rapid development in digital dentistry, having efficient 3D printing tools is essential to staying ahead, and pre-slicing processing is one of the important steps in 3D printing. Choosing a suitable slicer software has become a topic that every user cannot avoid. CHITUBOX Basic, as a household slicer software in the 3D printing industry, has been active in various industries for many years and has become the universal software with the highest market share. However, with the development of the industry, we are well aware that universal software cannot meet the unique needs of specific industries, so a new player targeting specific industries has emerged, that is CHITUBOX Dental, which is designed specifically for dentistry.
CHITUBOX Dental provides targeted powerful functions and a smooth and convenient preparation experience, making it more and more popular and loved by dentists, but Basic is still the choice of many dentists, and many users have difficulty choosing between these two options. Therefore, this article will deeply analyze the functional differences between Basic and Dental, as well as compare costs, to provide information reference for users to choose the software that best suits them.
