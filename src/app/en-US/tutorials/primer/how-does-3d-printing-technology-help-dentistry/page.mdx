# How does 3D Printing Technology Help Dentistry


With the continuous advancement of science and technology, 3D printing technology has gradually penetrated into various industries, as well as the dentistry. Although the traditional production method of dental products is mature, it has certain limitations in terms of efficiency, precision and personalization. The introduction of 3D printing technology has brought revolutionary changes to the dentistry. As the dentistry grows, competition is increasingly fierce. The introduction of new technologies can bring greater competitive advantages to dental practitioners. This article will explore the necessity of introducing 3D printing in the dental industry.

## Differences between traditional production methods and 3D printing methods

The traditional production method of dental products mainly relies on manual production and mechanical processing. It is necessary to first use silicone to print the tooth model and then turn it into a plaster mold. For products made of zirconium, metal and other materials, wax models, casting and other processes are also used. This method is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also prone to insufficient precision due to human factors, affecting the adaptability of the restoration. 3D printing technology is based on digital design and additive manufacturing principles. Through computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology, digital models are directly converted into physical products. Compared with the manual production mode, 3D printing can achieve higher precision and more complex personalized design. And the traditional method of making dentures may take several days, while 3D printing can be completed in a few hours. The use of 3D printing technology can significantly shorten the production cycle.

## Application status of 3D printing in the dental industry

In recent years, the application scope of 3D printing technology in the dental industry has continued to expand. At present, 3D printing has been widely used in the production of dental trays, models, surgical guides, orthodontic splints, retainers, crowns and bridges. With the advancement of technology, the application of 3D printing in the dental field is still expanding. For example, the emergence of new technologies such as multi-material one-piece jet dentures has further improved the function and aesthetics of restorations. In addition, the rise of artificial intelligence-driven workflows and biocompatible materials has also simplified the production of dental products such as temporary crowns, removable dentures, and invisible braces. According to market research institutions, the global dental 3D printing market size will exceed US$3 billion in 2023, and is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 20% by 2032.

## Why the dental industry needs to adopt 3D printing technology

As an industry with a high degree of customization, the dental industry requires extremely high precision. The main reasons for combining 3D printing technology are as follows:

**Improve precision and quality**: 3D printing can generate accurate physical models based on the patient's oral data, and manufacture restorations based on this, thereby reducing model errors and human errors caused by silicone materials, and improving the adaptability and comfort of restorations.

**Shorten the production cycle**: Traditional dental product production requires multiple manual steps, which takes a long time. 3D printing can complete the manufacture of complex structures in a short time, achieve same-day production and installation, and greatly improve treatment efficiency.

**Reduce labor costs**: Each step of the traditional manual mode requires a lot of manpower, while 3D printing directly produces models and products in digital mode, eliminating the production steps of re-molding, mold repair, wax model, etc. This greatly reduces labor costs for the operation of dental processing plants.

**Meet personalized needs**: As people's requirements for oral health and beauty continue to increase, personalized customization has become an important trend in the dental industry. 3D printing is suitable for processing parts with highly complex structures. It can tailor restorations according to the specific conditions of each patient to better meet the patient's personalized needs.

**Improve patient experience**: The application of 3D printing technology reduces the time patients have to wait for treatment and improves the comfort of treatment. For example, through digital scanning and 3D printing, patients do not need to endure the discomfort of traditional impressions

## Equipment and costs involved in the dental 3D printing process

The dental 3D printing process usually includes the following links:

**Oral scanning**: Use an intraoral scanner to obtain the patient's oral three-dimensional data. The market price of intraoral scanners is generally between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of yuan.

**Processing software**: Use professional CAD/CAM software to process and design the scanned data. The cost of the software varies from several thousand yuan to tens of thousands of yuan depending on the function and brand.

**3D printer**: Print according to the design model. The price of dental 3D printers varies depending on the brand and model, generally between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of yuan.

**Post-processing equipment**: After printing, the prints need to be cleaned, cured, polished and other post-processing. The cost of post-processing equipment is relatively low, generally between several thousand yuan and tens of thousands of yuan.

In general, the initial investment for a complete set of dental 3D printing equipment is about 100,000 yuan. Although the initial equipment investment is relatively high, in the long run, 3D printing technology can significantly reduce production costs, improve production efficiency and product quality.


## Summary

The application of 3D printing technology in the dental industry has significant advantages, including improving precision, shortening production cycles, reducing labor costs, meeting personalized needs and improving patient experience. With the continuous advancement of digital technology and the reduction of overall costs, more and more dental processing plants and medical institutions have begun to adopt 3D printing technology. The increasingly widespread application of 3D printing technology in the dental field will also drive the dental industry towards a more digital and intelligent direction. Only by timely understanding, learning and applying 3D printing technology can we gain more advantages in industry competition.
