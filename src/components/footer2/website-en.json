The software is developed by third-party providers and allows businesses to rebrand the software as their own. This model is favored for its ease of deployment and the ability to roll out products quickly without the burden of development and testing. Custom development, on the other hand, is a customization process where every aspect of the software is built according to the specific requirements of business debugging. With custom development, projects are often started from the ground up with a thorough analysis of business requirements, target markets, and long-term goals.",

So when CHITUBOX Basic V1.6.1 was released (in Nov 2019), CBD-Tech introduced a new file format tailored for LCD/DLP resin 3D printers – CTB (short for CHITUBOX). This format was lightweight, streamlined and highly extensible, and worked better with various resin 3D printers. As the functionalities of CHITUBOX continued to grow, the CTB format got updated continuously to fit in more application scenarios and support more resin printer features.",
				"p2": "Later, in 2021, LCD/DLP resin 3D printing technologies kept advancing, and so did the CHITUBOX software. So when CHITUBOX Basic V1.9.0 and CHITUBOX Pro were released, we introduced the new, upgraded CTB. This new format enables you to use the newly-added powerful features of the CHITUBOX software, such as Two-Stage Motion Control (TSMC), Resting Time, Multi-parameter Slice, and more.",
				"p3": "As the user base of CTB is rapidly growing, we also see requirements coming out from the developers in our communities and our business partners. To help them offer better products and services to the users, CBD-Tech publishes the standard and officially verified SDK for the CTB format. We hope these tools can simplify creative process for the developers and the partners and help them unleash their creativity."
